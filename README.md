└── script.js         # JavaScript logic for the buttons


💡 How It Works
Each button triggers a function (buttn_click() or equalTo()) on click.

The clicked value is displayed on the input screen.

When "=" is pressed, the expression is evaluated using JavaScript's eval() function.

"AC" clears the entire input screen using clear_screen().
